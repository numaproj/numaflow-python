# Side Input

The Side Input module provides classes and functions for implementing Side Inputs that inject external data into UDFs.

## Overview

Side Input allows you to inject external data into your UDFs. This is useful for configuration, lookup tables, or any data that UDFs need but isn't part of the main data stream.
