# Developer Guide

This document explains the development process for the Numaflow Python SDK.

### Testing

1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) before starting your test. Make sure you have the correct Python version
2. Make your SDK changes
3. Update the `example.py` file inside the desired example directory if needed 
4. Run `make image TAG=<tag>` inside the same example directory to build your image with an appropriate tag
5. Now that you have the image with your customized example and code change, you can test it in a Numaflow pipeline. 
Example pipelines, `pipeline.yaml`, are also provided in most of the example directories. Ensure to update the image tag in
the `pipeline.yaml` file to the one you used when building your image

Each example directory has a Makefile which can be used to build, tag, and push images.
If you want to build and tag the image and then immediately push it to quay.io, use the `image-push` target.
If you want to build and tag a local image without pushing, use the `image` target.

If you would like to build and push a specific example, you can do so by running:
```shell
./hack/update_examples.sh -bpe <example-directory-path> -t <tag>
```
This is essentially equivalent to running `make image-push TAG=<tag>` in the example directory itself.
The default tag is `stable`, but it is recommended you specify your own for testing purposes, as the Github Actions CI uses the `stable` tag.
This consistent tag name is used so that the tags in the [E2E test pipelines](https://github.com/numaproj/numaflow/tree/main/test) do not need to be updated each time an SDK change is made.

Note: before running the script, ensure that through the CLI, you are logged into quay.io.

### Deploying

After confirming that your changes pass local testing:
1. Clean up testing artifacts (remove any test images on quay.io, etc.)
2. Create a PR for your changes. Once your PR has been merged, a Github Actions workflow (`Docker Publish`) will be triggered, to build, tag (with `stable`), and push
all example images. This ensures that all example images are using the most up-to-date version of the SDK, i.e. the one including your
changes

### Adding a New Example

If you add a new example, in order for it to be used by the `Docker Publish` workflow, add its path
to the `example_directories` matrix in `.github/workflows/build-push.yaml`.
